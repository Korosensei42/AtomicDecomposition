Setup:

Be sure to have the required packages in the corresponding folder installed to your python.
Also, please have the folder graphviz somewhere on your machine and its bin-folder linked in your 
PATH-environmentvariable

Within your cmd or linux bash navigate to the folder where these three files are.
Then execute python setupSPASSfile.py

The text that shows up within the cmd should be self-explanatory.


A note on the test-file:
You can have various testfiles with arbitrary names. The filename is asked for by the Python-file 
everytime it gets executed.

Regarding the syntax of the input:
This should get clear when playing around with what happens after you enter "Y" when being asked if
you want to be guided. After you finish your input (this is decided by the program) 
it is displayed in the form it is used within the program.
From there you should be able to extrapolate the syntax.

An example containing an arithmetical formula as well as a setformula is given in the file Test.txt.
